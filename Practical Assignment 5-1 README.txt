This program should work if you can get the customer to accept invasive advertising.  A high percentage of people accept the coupon, but it does not seem to be related to their direction of travel or proximity to the restaurant at the time they receive the coupon.  It looks like they go to the restaurant later in the day or the next day rather than right away.  The exception may be when the they have a friend in the car.  Then, they may decide to enjoy a nice time out with their friend.  It helps if there are two or more people in the car (not kids).  It looks like the program works mainly due to the invasive nature of the advertising.  Popup advertising while driving does not seem like something the customer would want to have.  Pop up advertising has not yet penetrated private spaces such as in a car.  It may be just as effective to use their home address and send the ad to their phone.    It looks like any restaurant within a reasonable distance will work.  They don't need to be right next to the car and in the direction of travel.  They may also develop a blindness to the ads if they are used too often.
